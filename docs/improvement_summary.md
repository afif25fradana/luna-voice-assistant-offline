- Integrated into main application startup

### 4. Implemented Graceful Shutdown Handling
- Added signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM in GUI module
- Proper resource cleanup procedures
- TTS and STT shutdown procedures
- Prevention of multiple shutdown attempts

## Medium Priority Improvements Completed

### 1. Added Type Hints to All Modules
- Enhanced `modul_helper.py` with comprehensive type hints
- Added type hints to `modul_stt.py` for better IDE support
- Added type hints to `modul_ai.py` for improved code documentation
- Added type hints to `modul_memory.py` for better error detection
- Improved code maintainability and developer experience

### 2. Improved Error Handling and Recovery
- Enhanced exception handling in `modul_helper.py`
- Better error messages and logging
- Proper handling of PermissionError for security violations
- More robust subprocess execution with proper error handling

### 3. Enhanced Security Features
- Comprehensive command safety validation
- Improved permission checking for dangerous commands
- Better blacklist implementation
- Safer subprocess execution with shlex.split

### 4. Better Code Documentation
- Added detailed docstrings to all functions and classes
- Improved inline comments for complex logic
- Better parameter and return type documentation
- Enhanced code readability

## Fixed Syntax Issues

### 1. Unterminated f-string Literals
- Fixed `SyntaxError: unterminated f-string literal` in `modul_ai.py`
- Corrected multiline f-string formatting issues
- Verified all Python files compile without syntax errors

### 2. Relative Import Issues
- Fixed relative import problems in `modul_helper.py` and `config_validator.py`
- Added fallback mechanisms for test environments
- Ensured proper module loading in all contexts

## Verification Results

All improvements have been verified:
- ✅ All Python files compile without syntax errors
- ✅ All 14 unit tests pass successfully
- ✅ Application starts and runs correctly
- ✅ New features work as expected
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality

## Impact

These improvements significantly enhance the Luna Voice Assistant's:
